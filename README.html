<h1>README - run_analysis.R</h1>

<h1>Purpose:</h1>

<pre><code>To do some data analysis, and data cleanup on measurements taken
from up to 30 subjects, and their motions as measured by 
smartphones, as they performed 6 different activities.
</code></pre>

<h1>Inputs:</h1>

<pre><code>X_train.txt  = file of training observations
y_train.txt = class variable, one for each training observation
X_test.txt = file of test observations
y_test.txt = class variable, one for each test observation

features.txt = file that maps the 561 measurements to their names, 
                to be used for the variable or column names
subject_train.txt = file of the subject number participant, 
                one for each observation in the training set,
                varies between 1 and 30
subject_test.txt = file of the subject number participant, 
                one for each observation in the test set,
                varies between 1 and 30
activity_labels.txt = file of descriptions for each of 6 activities 
                that are measured in this experiment

ASSUMPTION: the files will all reside in the same directory as 
                the run_analysis program.
</code></pre>

<h1>Original source of the data files:</h1>

<p>DATA SOURCE CITATION:  [1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra 
 and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a 
 Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop 
 of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012</p>

<h1>Output:</h1>

<pre><code>File name:  tidy_analysis.txt

Format:     comma-seperated-file, with headers, saved with a .txt extension.

Description:  For each measurement that focused on the mean and standard 
            deviation of the various movements that were measured in the
            experiment, we calculate a mean for each measurement grouped by 
            the subject number, and the activity.  For instance, for subject 
            number 1, and for their activity of WALKING, calculate a mean
            for each of the measurements already summarized by a mean or a 
            standard deviation.
</code></pre>

<h1>Processing -  The following steps were taken:</h1>

<pre><code>Since the original files where divided into training observations, training classification,
testing observations and testing classification, they were combined into one large file.

Since the original column names may have had duplicates, the column names where made unique
by appending either a &quot;.1&quot;, or &quot;.2&quot; as appropriate.

Append the class labels to the observations.

Append the activity labels to each observations, matched on activity number.

Append the subject numbers to each observation.

Fcous only on those columns that resulted in a measurement of the mean, 
or a standard deviation. These columns had &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;std&quot; as part of the
feature name. I ignored those that also had &quot;meanFreq&quot; as part of the name.

Finally, calculate a mean on each of those columns as grouped by
subject and activity. Write this out to the file tidy_analysis.txt as
a comma-seperated file.
